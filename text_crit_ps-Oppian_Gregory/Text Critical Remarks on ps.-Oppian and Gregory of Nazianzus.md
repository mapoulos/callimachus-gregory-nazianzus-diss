# Text Critical Remarks on ps.-Oppian and Gregory of Nazianzus

###### Alex Poulos, Washington DC

**Abstract:**  In this article I propose textual emendations for one passage in ps.-Oppian’s *Cynegetica* (1.59–61) and several passages in the works of Gregory of Nazianzus (*carm.* 1.1.3 29; 2.1.1 294 and 353; 2.1.32 7; 2.1.39 58–62; *or.* 41.16).  
  
  



## Ps.-Oppian *Cyn.* 1.59–61

In the opening of the *Halieutica*, Oppian had stated that fishing was a more laborious task than hunting, and hence more worthy of song (*Hal.* 1.28). In *Cyn.* 1.58–61, ps.-Oppian coyly responds by observing the delight of the fisherman as he hooks a fish. I print here from the edition of M. Papathomopoulos.[^2]

> τερπωλὴ δ’, ὅτε **χαλκὸν**[^3] ὑπαὶ[^4] γενύεσσι τορήσας \\
> ὕψι μάλα θρώσκοντα βυθῶν ὕπερ ἀσπαίροντα [60] \\
> εἰνάλιον φορέῃσι δι’ ἠέρος ὀρχηστῆρα. 

>  There is delight when the copper hook pierces the fish below its jowls and drags the fish up as it gasps and leaps up wildly from the depths, dancing through the air.

Though the sense is generally clear, the syntax is difficult to construe. In 1.59, Papathomopoulos has followed the manuscripts in printing the accusative singular χαλκόν, but this yields little sense. W. Schmitt understood that  τορήσας as *durchführen lassen*, but I have found no attestations of this meaning.[^5] Elsewhere the direct object of τορέω is the object pierced, not the instrument of piercing.[^6] Mair followed Turnebus and Bodinus by printing the conjecture χαλκοῦ and took γενύεσσι not as the jaws of the fish, but the barbs of the fishhook (v. LSJ *s.v.* II).[^7] This sense is well attested in the *Halieutica*, but it this would be its only such use in the *Cynegetica*. We should instead take γενύεσσι to refer jaws of the fish; I propose emending to the nominative χαλκός. Compare Apol. Rhod. *Arg.* 2.112–13:  ὅσον δ’ ἐπὶ δέρματι μοῦνον / νηδυίων ἄψαυστος ὑπὸ ζώνην **τόρε χαλκός**. This furthermore avoids the epic correption created by emending χαλκὸν to the genitive χαλκοῦ.



## Gr. Naz. *carm* 1.1.3 (*Poem. arc.* 3: *De spiritu*) 29

In *Poem. arc.* 3, Gregory argues that the divinity of the Holy Spirit has not been fully revealed until his own time. I reproduce the apparatus and line as they appear in the edition of Moreschini and Sykes.[^8]

> βαιὸν τοῖσδ’ ὑπέλαμψε, τὸ δὲ πλέον **ἡμὶν**[^9] ἔλειπεν.  

Moreschini prints the oxytone form of the dative second person plural pronoun. Of the codices Moreschini used to constitute the edition, I have only been able to consult Va (Vat. gr. 482), but I presume that like Va they transmit the unmetrical ἡμῖν. Though Moreschini’s conjecture is a modest improvement, it is unlikely that Gregory would use in a hexametric poem a form attested only in Sophocles. We should instead write the  properispomenon ἧμιν, which is attested in Homer.[^10] The reading of L, ἄμμιν, would also be suitable, but it is paleographically more likely that the original reading (ΗΜΙΝ) produced the error ἡμῖν than that ΑΜΜΙΝ was corrupted ἡμῖν.[^11]

## Gr. Naz. *carm* 2.1.1 (*De rebus suis*) 294. 

In this passage, Gregory juxtaposes his present spiritual suffering with past periods of blessing and spiritual prosperity. I print from the edition of Tuilier and Bady. [^12] I report selectively from their apparatus, omitting variants that are plainly scribal slips.[^13]

> Νῦν δὲ δὴ[^14] ἐξαπόλωλε **κειμήλια** πάντ’ ἀπ’ ἐμοῖο   
> ψυχῆς. 


The editors have printed the unmetrical κειμήλια (“heirlooms” or “inheritance”), which must be scanned  ˘ ¯ ˘ ˘, even though the syllable κει- is by nature long. Gregory does depart from classical prosody on occasion; yetm this is a license he uses more often in iambic poetry, and nearly always with *dichrona* (α ι υ) rather than with diphthongs.[^15] There is one other instance where a stream of the tradition of Gregory’s poetry presents κειμήλια with a short first syllable. At 2.2.6 108, the majority of the manuscripts (C, Mq and Lb) carry either κειμήλιον or κιμήλιον . L, by contrast, reads γαμείλιον (“wedding gift”), the source of the reading γαμήλιον adopted by Bacci for her edition.[^16] The reading of L is perhaps a scholarly conjecture, for several scholars have suspected the scribe of L in engaging in scholarly emendation.[^17] Yet if γαμήλιον is his conjecture, then it is a remarkably good one, for *carm.* 2.2.6 is presented as a wedding gift for a young bride. 

At *De rebus suis* 294, Gregory is indebted to *Il.* 18.290: νῦν δὲ δὴ ἐξαπόλωλε δόμων κειμήλια καλά (“But now all the lovely heirlooms have disappeared from the house”). According to the TLG, *DRS* 294 is the only other hexametric line attested that begins νῦν δὲ δὴ ἐξαπόλωλε. There are two solutions to the problem. First, we may suppose that Gregory wrote κιμήλια instead of κειμήλια. This does not fix the false quantity, but it would suggest that Gregory deliberately shortened the vowel. Such an adaptation, however, would be quite clumsy, for comparison with the Homeric source would immediately reveal the false quantity. Rather, I suspect that κειμήλια has intruded improperly from the *Iliad* into *DRS* 294. I propose instead that Gregory wrote θεμείλια (“foundations”).  We may translate “But now all the foundations have disappeared from my soul.” Reading θεμείλια here would  increase the resonance with *DRS* 322 θεμείλια σείετο πάντα, where the foundations of Greece are shaken in an earthquake, and *DRS* 359 καὶ νηοῦ μεγάλοιο θεμείλια χερσὶ βάληται, where the foundations of Solomon’s temple are destroyed by the Babylonians. If I am correct, the corruption of θεμείλια to κιμήλια occurred quite early. Not only would the corruption be easier in uncial, but Hesychius’ entry for κιμήλιον almost certainly derives from this passage.[^18] 

## Gr. Naz. *carm* 2.1.1 *De rebus suis* 353 

Gregory expresses his desperate need for purification and exhorts his reader to benefit from his example. I print the text of Tuilier and Bady with select readings from their apparatus.

> Τίς δώσει κεφαλῇ πηγῆς ῥόον[^19] ἢ βλεφάροισιν     
> ὡς δακρύων ὀχετοῖσι μολύσματα πάντα καθήρω,    
> κλαύσας ὡς ἐπέκοικεν ἁμαρτάδας; ἦ γὰρ ἄριστον    
> δάκρυόν ἐστι βροτοῖσιν ἄκος ψυχαῖς τε μελαίναις    
> καὶ κόνις αἰθαλόεσσα καὶ ἐν χθονὶ σάκκος ἐρυμνός.[^20]  [350]     
> ὥς[^21] τις ἔμ’ εἰσορόων **τρομέῃ** καὶ φέρτερος εἴη    
> φεύγων Αἰγύπτοιο μέλαν πέδον ἔργα τε πικρὰ    
> καὶ Φαραὼ βασιλῆα, πατρὴν δ’  ἐπὶ **θείαν** **ὀδεύῃ**    
> μηδὲ μένῃ Βαβυλῶνος ἐνὶ κραναῆς πεδίοισι    
> δουριαλής, ὄχθῃσι παρεζόμενος ποταμοῖο,  [355]  
> ᾠδῆς ὄργανα πάνατα παρακλίνας ἀτίνακτα    
> δακρυόεις, **σπευδῇ** δ' ἱερῆς ἐπὶ τέρματα γαίης





Bernardi, Caillau, and Meehan all regard the ὡς in 347 as subordinating conjunction of purpose and take ἢ in a conjunctive sense (“and”) rather than a disjunctive (“or”).[^22] This does poor justice to Gregory’s (admittedly elusive) train of thought. In 347–49, Gregory describes two means of purification: baptism (τίς δώσει κεφαλῇ πηγῆς ῥόον) and repentance through tears (the remainder of 347 through the bucolic diaeresis in 349). We should regard ἢ as disjunctive (“or”) and ὡς as an adverb (“like” or “as”) rather than a conjunction (“in order that”). The aorist subjunctive καθήρω is thus an independent deliberative subjunctive.[^23] This reading would be more clear if punctuate with a question mark after πηγῆς ῥόον. Literally, we may render the lines so, “Who shall give a flow of water to my head? or shall I cleanse all my transgressions with eyes like channels of tears, by weeping in a fitting manner for my sins?”

Bernardi and Meehan have both rightly translated the 351–57 as a wish.[^24]  Such a rendering, however, is impossible as the text stands, for, unlike Latin, Greek does not use the independent 3rd person subjective to express a positive wish.[^25] The subjectives require that we translate the lines as a subordinate purpose clause, as did Caillau, but this is results in extremely difficult syntax, for we would need to take 348–50 (ἦ γὰρ ἄριστον … σάκκος ἐρυμνός) as a long parenthetical. Instead, we should print optatives in 351 (τρομέοι), 353 (ὁδεύοι, following S and La) and 357 (σπεύδοι). The subjunctive in 354 (μένῃ) should stand, for the 3rd person independent subjunctive is typical for prohibitions, even if the present, rather than aorist subjunctive, is unusual.[^26]

In 353, the α in θείαν is long by nature. Gregory not infrequently scans the final alpha of a noun or adjective short, even when it is long by nature. This is, however, a liberty he more frequently uses in iambic than hexametric verse.  Gregory scans this particular adjective (θείαν) as a trochee also at 2.1.10 147 (iambic) and 2.1.34a 49 (elegiac). We should print, however, synonym δῖαν, which lies the corrupt reading of Lc, δ’ εἴαν. The sense of θεῖος and δῖος is more or less the same. Homer uses it in this *sedes* ad *Il.* 9.662, 21.43, 24.32 and *Od.* 19.50, 540. Gregory uses δῖαν at 2.1.22 9 (σπεύδων ἐς χθόνα δῖαν, ἐμὸν λάχος, ὥσπερ ὑπέσης, “hurrying toward the blessed land, my lot, just as you promised”). It would be easy for the rare δῖαν to be replaced by the more common θείαν, as by Gregory’s period δ was pronounced as a voiced dental fricative (the *th* in “this”) instead of a voiced alveolar plosive (the ‘d’  in “do”).[^27] 

## Gr. Naz. *carm* 2.1.32 (*De uitae huius uanitate atque incertitudine*) 7

Gregory expresses the desire to escape from human company altogether, or to take take up an aerial position and thunder forth like an Old Testament prophet. I print the edition of Simelidis with a selection of his apparatus:

>  Ἤθελον ἠὲ πέλεια τανύπτερος, ἠὲ χελιδὼν      
> ἔμμεναι, ὥς κε φύγοιμι βροτῶν βίον, ἤ τιν’ ἔρημον    
> ναιετάειν θήρεσσιν ὁμέστιος (οἳ γὰρ ἔασι    
> πιστότεροι μερόπων), καὶ ἠμάτιον βίον ἕλκειν,    
> νηπενθῆ, νήποινον, ἀκηδέα· ἓν τόδ’ ἄθηρον [5]   
> μοῦνον ἔχειν, θεότητος ἴδριν νόον, οὐρανοφοίτην,   
> ὥς κε γαληνιόωντι βίῳ φάος αἰὲν **ἀγείρω[^28]**·       
> Ἤ τινος ἠερίης σκοπιῆς καθύπερθεν ἀερθεὶς,    
> βρονταῖον πάντεσσιν ἐπιχθονίοισιν ἀῧσαι[^29]· 

According to the edition of Simelidis,[^30] the manuscripts all transmit a form of ἀγείρω in line 7. Yet, "so that I may in a peaceful life gather light” is a strange locution, and unprecedented so far as I can gather from the TLG. I suspect that Gregory instead wrote ἐγείρω (“raise”). We would then understand  φάος in line 7 to refer to the eye: “so that in a life of repose I may continually raise my eye [towards heaven]." This fits nicely with the emphasis on the visual in lines 8–9, where the poet takes up an aerial vantage point (ἠερίης σκοπιῆς) and looks down on the rest of humanity.

Simelidis selects the less-well attested ἀΰσαι the appropriate variant in line 9 on the grounds that it is subordinate to ἤθελον in line 1 and parallel with ἔμμεναι (2), ναιετάειν (3), ἕλκειν (4), and ἔχειν (6).  The external evidence, however, supports the 1st person aorist subjunctive ἀΰσω, for the aorist infinitive is confined to the α branch of the tradition.[^31] This is syntactically licit so long as we regard the ἤ in line 8 as subordinate to the purpose clause beginning in line 7 (ὥς κε…) instead of in parallel with the alternatives expressed in 1–6. We may thus translate, “…to have a mind that traverses heaven, so that in peace I may continually raise my eye or rise up above to some aerial vantage point and thunder down on all mortals below.” 

## Gr. Naz. *carm.* 2.1.39 (*In uersus suos*) 58–62

I print here the edition of De Blasi:[^32]

> Πρὸς ταῦτα νῦν γινώσκεθ’[^33] ἡμῖν, οἱ σοφοί,    
> τῶν **ἔνδον** εἰ δ’ ἥττησθε, τῶν αὐτῶν λόγων    
> πλεῖστον τὸ **χρῆμα** καὶ τὰ παιζόντων **λόγοι**  [60]   
> χωρεῖτε. μακρὸν δ’ οὐδὲν οὐδ’ ὑπὲρ κόρον    
> ἀλλ’ οὐδ’ ἄχρηστον ὡς ἐγῷμαι παντελῶς.    

In line 59, De Blasi has removed the punctuation that Caillau placed after τῶν ἔνδον. However, the εἰ δέ that follows shows that τῶν ἔνδον belongs with the prior line.[^34] We should thus punctuate with a full stop after ἔνδον, as did Caillau.

In line 60, I would punctuate after χρῆμα and then take the following καί as adverbial (“even”) rather than conjunctive (“and”).[^35] The end of the line (τὰ παιζόντων λόγοι) is nonsensical, as De Blasi notes.[^36] Emending the nominative plural (λόγοι) to the dative plural (λόγοις) restores the sense of the lines. Gregory asserts the utility of his verse (τῶν αὐτῶν λόγων / πλεῖστον τὸ χρῆμα “there is great utility in the words themselves!”) and then bids his opponents to accept even the things characteristic of those who play with words (καί τὰ παιζόντων λόγοις / χωρεῖτε), *i.e*. stylistic adornment and tropes. The lines that follow offer further support for this interpretation, for there are several verbal parallels with Gregory’s discussion of tropes in *ep.* 51.5. Compare the following:

| *carm.* 2.1.39 | *ep.* 51 |
| --- | --- |  
| μακρὸν δ’ οὐδὲν | οὔτε μακρότερα γραπτέον… | 
| οὐδ’ ὑπὲρ κόρον | τὸ δ’ἄπληστον |
| οὐδ’ ἄχρηστον … παντελῶς | ἔστι δὲ μέτρον τῶν ἐπιστολῶν ἡ χρεία | 


## Gr. Naz. *Or*. 41.16

In this passage, Gregory juxtaposes the tower of Babel (Gen. 11:1–9) with the events of Pentecost described in Acts 2:1–13. I print here the edition of Moreschini in *SC* 358.[^37]


>  Πλὴν ἐπαινετὴ μὲν καὶ ἡ παλαιὰ διαίρεσις τῶν φωνῶν (ἡνίκα τὸν πύργον ᾠκοδόμουν οἱ κακῶς καὶ ἀθέως ὁμοφωνοῦντες, ὥσπερ καὶ τῶν νῦν τολμῶσί τινες)· τῇ γὰρ τῆς φωνῆς διαστάσει συνδιαλυθὲν τὸ ὁμόγνωμον, τὴν ἐγχείρησιν ἔλυσεν· ἀξιεπαινετωτέρα δὲ ἡ νῦν θαυματουργουμένη. Ἀπὸ γὰρ ἑνὸς Πνεύματος εἰς πολλοὺς χυθεῖσα, εἰς μίαν ἁρμονίαν πάλιν συνάγεται. **Καὶ ἔστι διαφορὰ χαρισμάτων, ἄλλου[^38] δεομένη χαρίσματος, πρὸς διάκρισιν τῆς[^39] βελτίονος· ἐπειδὴ πᾶσαι τὸ ἐπαινετὸν ἔχουσι. Καλὴ δ’ ἂν κἀκείνη λέγοιτο** περὶ ἧς Δαβὶδ λέγει· Καταπόντισον, Κύριε, καὶ καταδίελε τὰς γλώσσας αὐτῶν. Διατί; Ὅτι ἠγάπησαν πάντα τὰ ῥήματα καταποντισμοῦ γλῶσσαν δολίαν· μόνον οὐχὶ φανερῶς τὰς ἐνταῦθα γλώσσας καταιτιώμενος, αἳ θεότητα τέμνουσιν. Ταῦτα μὲν οὖν ἐπὶ τοσοῦτον.  

The portion running from καὶ ἔστι διαφορὰ … ἐπειδὴ πᾶσαι τὸ ἐπαινετὸν ἔχουσι is particularly difficult to understand as the text currently stands. The translations that I have consulted[^40] all render the phrase equivalently to this in English:  

> And there is a multiplicity of gifts that requires another gift to distinguish which is the better one, since all are worthy of honor. We may also call good the division about which David said, “Drown, O Lord, and scatter their tongues…”

Such a rendering is problematic on both an argumentative and a grammatical level. First, for διαφορά the sense “multiplicity” or “diversity” is not attested in the lexica.[^41] The noun most likely here means  “kind” or “type.” Second, it is unclear why Gregory should wish to dwell on the ranking of the various spiritual charisms when the main point of the paragraph is to juxtapose Babel and Pentecost and paint his Arian rivals as new “tower-builders.”

I propose first that we take a cue from Gregory’s Byzantine commentator Nicetas, who has rightly recognized that διαφορά means “type” or “kind.”:

> ἡ µέντοι διαφορὰ τῶν χαρισµάτων, ἡ δεοµένη ἄλλου χαρίσµατος πρὸς διάκρισιν, ἡ προφητεία ἐστὶ καὶ τὸ λαλεῖν γλώσσαις. ἡ µὲν γὰρ προφητεία δεῖται τοῦ χαρίσµατος τῆς διακρίσεως τῶν πνευµάτων. τὸ δὲ χάρισµα τῶν γλωσσῶν, χρήζει τοῦ τῆς ἑρµηνείας.[^42]

> The type of gift that requires another gift for clarification is prophecy and speaking in other languages. For prophecy needs the gift of discernment of spirits and the gift of tongues requires that of interpretation. 


 I furthermore propose that the phrase πρὸς διάκρισιν τῆς βελτίονος means not, “to discern which is the best gift,” as Rufinus, Nicetas, and the modern translators have it, but “to interpret the better kind [of gift].” Gregory is referring rather elusively to Paul’s requirement that the charism of speaking in foreign tongues be accompanied by the charism of interpretation (1 Cor. 14:1–12), and to Paul’s hierarchy of higher and lower gifts (1 Cor. 12:31). 

Next, I propose that we re-punctuate so that ἐπειδὴ πᾶσαι … ἔχουσι is joined instead with it the clause that follows it.[^43] This requires the following changes: first, we should place a full-stop after πρὸς διάκρισιν τοῦ βελτίονος and a comma after ἔχουσι;  instead of ἐπειδὴ we should write ἐπεὶ δὲ; third, we should write καλὴ κἂν ἐκείνη instead of καλὴ δ’ἂν κἀκείνη. I suspect the ΕΠΕΙΔΕ was corrupted to ΕΠΕΙΔΗ rather early, as the change is easier in uncial, and that a δέ was inserted after καλή to compensate. The text thus runs:

> Καὶ ἔστι διαφορὰ χαρισμάτων ἄλλου δεομένη χαρίσματος πρὸς διάκρισιν τοῦ βελτίονος. ἐπεὶ δὲ πᾶσαι τὸ ἐπαινετὸν ἔχουσι, καλὴ κἂν ἐκείνη λέγοιτο…


> And this [division] is the type of gift that requires another gift to clarify the better one. Moreover, since all these [divisions of languages] have merit, we may also deem good that one about which David said…

[^15]:	@crimigregorio1995 104–107 provide a list of prosodic irregularities in Gregory’s iambic 1.2.10 *De virtute*. Their list is too capacious, as they occasionally note irregularities even when there is classical precedent. For instance, they include  ὑμὶν in 1.2.10 513 as a prosodic irregularity, but there is Sophoclean precedent for this form, which they observe in a note. From this larger list, I have noted 27 irregularities in 998 lines, or about 1 every 36 lines. In the 192 lines of hexameter that I have examined (*carm.* 1.1.3 and *carm.* 2.1.1 294–392), I have found 3 prosodic irregularities, 2 of which have likely emendations. Even if we follow the manuscripts and print the false quantities, this is only 1 irregularity in every 64 lines. If we emend, then the ratio jumps to 1 in 192 lines. For treatments of Gregory’s departures from classical prosody, see @crimiil1972 and @oberhausgregor1991 26–31. These departures are typically called “false quantities,” but this appellation is too classicizing, for at least some of them may be intentional. See @Simelidis-SelectedPoemsGregory-2009 36, 54–55.

	Caillau’s Latin rendering better captures the Greek text as printed:  *Quis det capiti fontis fluentum, et palpebris / Ut lacrymarum rivis sordes omnes eluam / lugens, ut decet, peccata*. 

	Meehan’s translates, “O for a flood from my head and from my eyes, so that rivers of tears might wash away all stains, and I bewail in due fashion my sins.” This awkwardly takes the datives as expressing source and translates δακρύων ὀχετοῖσι as though it were the subject of the sentence instead of an agent.
